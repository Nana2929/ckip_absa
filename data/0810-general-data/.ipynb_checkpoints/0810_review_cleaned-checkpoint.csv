Manzih Hong,3.0,"The dumplings are delicious, big and delicious, the pork filling with leeks is perfect! A piece of 8.5 yuan is very consistent with the CP value. Soups are worth ordering. There are a lot of ingredients. The oyster soup is delicious, but the hot and sour soup is not sour or spicy although it has a lot of ingredients. In terms of luwei, the most recommended is the braised cabbage head and the attached sauerkraut. I ordered the smoked Matsuzaka pork that everyone recommends, but the meat is very dry and the taste is quite salty. Other tofu skin, bitter gourd, and pig scalp are quite ordinary. I didn't give five stars because the environment is really dirty. I hope the boss can take a few days off to clean up the environment.

Sunny Chung,5.0,"This is a soup restaurant The soups sold every day are not fixed. It is recommended to go to FB to see today's soups and check if there is anything you want to drink.

Otherwise, it is easy to see that after watching it at noon, you will find that it is different from what you watched at noon when you go to the scene at night. My personal favorite is the Mushroom Bamboo Shoot Cartilage Soup and Tomato Minced Pork Sauce Soup The soup with minced tomato and pork sauce tastes like Mapo tofu. XD Creamy soup is also good, suitable for dipping bread But I don't really like beef and wild vegetable stew in sauce.

The dumplings are one size larger than those sold by other stores, and there is only one kind of filling: minced pork + cabbage + chives; the filling is like a bun filling, which is quite elastic and firm, unlike ordinary dumpling fillings, you can use the dumplings here Imagine a bun with dumpling skin. Dine-in is 8.5 yuan, and a pack of 30 frozen dumplings is 240 yuan. There are about 20 kinds of lo mei items to choose from, such as dried tofu, kelp, beef, beef tendon, tripe, pig scalp, pig ears, pig nose...etc. The lo mei is placed at the door of the store. If you want to eat lo mei, you have to order it here. The store will burn it first, add Chaotian pepper and sauerkraut stalks, and then deliver it to your table. Luwei is delicious, and the result is that you want to eat everything. The amount of luwei at checkout often exceeds the amount of staple food (dumplings, pasta). The dry noodles are sweet and the taste is average. The pork liver of the pork liver soup is hard, and the soup is sweet, but it is quite smooth.

Beverage-Royal Wedding Song Tea (220RMB): The most satisfying diet this time, pure tea and fresh milk are two different tea drinks, and they taste quite layered, with a bit of cream and grass aroma. Dessert - Tiramisu (RMB 140): Tiramisu is of high quality, and it falls to the ground. Finger biscuits and mascarpone cheese soaked in coffee wine are used. The wine has a strong aroma and is delicious. price: The overall price is a little high, but the feeling is quite good, very suitable for friends and family dinner.",a week ago,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/103223899080478146992/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNkbvrp7v5AhW9D0QIHVSiCk8QvfQBegQIARAC,8/1 至店上用餐 服務：良好，會主動詢問餐點口味以及上餐順序，並提醒準備時間。 飲食： 前菜-白松露奶油燉蛋（280元）表現相當優異的餐點，白松露與奶油燉蛋的搭配非常香，與麵包一起食用可以感受得到兩者交融的美味，但希望麵包可以換成較為歐式的硬餐包。 主食-貓耳朵麵（300元）：很有特色的麵款，貓耳朵煮得帶有嚼勁，搭配脫皮的香腸與花椰菜，整體偏鹹，但很美味。 飲料-皇家結婚曲茶（220元）：本次最滿意的飲食，純茶與加了鮮奶之後是兩種不同茶飲，且喝起來相當有層次，帶點奶油與青草香氣。 甜點-提拉米蘇（140元）：表現優質的提拉米蘇，且十分倒地，使用了泡過咖啡酒水液的手指餅乾與馬斯卡彭乳酪，酒香較為濃厚，很好吃。 價格： 整體價格略高，但感受相當良好，很適合朋友家人聚餐。,Solo Pasta,ChIJwQPcmc-rQjQRtXDQA__PPwg,4.6

Jessica Huang,5.0,"In fact, this is the second visit~ Because I have never been to Italy😆, I can't comment on the taste, but the store emphasizes that they attach great importance to tradition, which should be very authentic! Although the taste may not be very suitable for personal eating habits, but it definitely reflects the attention of the restaurant in cooking! (I just don't like meat-based food, so this time my favorite is basil green sauce noodles, tea and tiramisu) The shop assistants are also very kind! I have eaten duck breast noodles and cat ear noodles before, which should be considered meaty dishes~ Cheese roll is a dish I have never seen! It is also a taste I have never imagined. It has a citrus flavor in the middle and a ghee on the outer skin. If you have never tasted it, you can try it! Although I prefer tiramisu. Tiramisu rum (? strong flavor",a week ago,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/115867495644593760436/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj52ofsp7v5AhX-KkQIHVh3AcMQvfQBegQIARAC,其實是二訪了～因為沒去過義大利😆所以沒辦法評論口味如何，不過店家特別強調他們重視傳統，應該就是很道地! 雖然味道上不一定會很合個人的飲食習慣，但絕對吃的出來店家在料理上的用心!（剛好我比較不喜歡肉味為主的食物，因此這次最喜歡的是羅勒青醬麵、茶和提拉米蘇） 店員也都滿親切的! 之前有點過鴨胸麵跟貓耳朵麵，應該也算是肉味較重的料理～ 起司捲則是我從來沒看過的料理! 也是我從來沒想像過的味道，中間有柑橘味、外皮有酥油感，沒有吃過感覺可以試試看! 雖然還是更推提拉米蘇。提拉米蘇的蘭姆酒(?味道很濃,Solo Pasta,ChIJwQPcmc-rQjQRtXDQA__PPwg,4.6

Stanley Lin,5.0,"20222.07 changed the name of the store, and there is a new menu of udon noodles, which is super delicious, the soup tastes very good, and there is a choice of two sauces, scallion sauce or pepper and spicy sauce, I like it very much! A shop I love very much. It uses solid ingredients. Every day, I continue to work hard to cook all kinds of delicious soups. I will order a set meal and enjoy two kinds of soups at a time. I have almost drank all the menus for one round. Love their classic beef stew and thick shrimp soup, the beef soup is tomato base, the beef stew is tender and chunky, with asparagus, peas, cheese, it's really rich, and when you want something refreshing Just pair it with witch soup. There are different vegetarian soups every day, and there are often surprises. The creamy porcini mushroom soup is a piece of chicken thigh. There are really foods that the store is so willing to make, and there are also cream or tomato flavors. The meat sauce soup, the point is that the dining environment is very good, it is a good place to eat and chat with friends, I really recommend it to everyone. By the way, lemon egg salad is super suitable for summer, refreshing and greasy, with almond slices on top!",a week ago,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/110357195224772641551/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjokbXqp7v5AhUNLEQIHXUVC_MQvfQBegQIARAZ,20222.07換了店名，竟然有新菜單烏龍麵，超級好吃，湯頭的味道很不錯，還有附沾醬二選一，蔥油醬或是椒麻辣醬，都好讚好喜歡！ 非常愛的一家店，用料紮實，每天都持續的努力熬煮各種好喝的湯品，都會點套餐一次享用兩種湯品，幾乎把菜單都喝過一輪了，算是非常久的顧客，最喜歡他們的經典牛肉燉湯和濃蝦湯，牛肉湯是番茄基底，牛肉燉的軟嫩又大塊，還有蘆筍、豌豆、起司，喝起來真的很豐富，另外想要清爽一點的時候就搭配巫婆湯，每天都不同的素湯，常常會有驚喜的搭配，奶油牛肝菌菇湯，是一塊塊的雞腿肉，真的有店家這麼願意做好的食物，也有奶油或是蕃茄口味的肉醬湯，重點是用餐環境很不錯，是和朋友吃飯聊天的好地方，真心推薦給大家。對了，夏天吃檸檬蛋沙拉超級適合，清爽又解膩，上頭還有杏仁片！,小湯烏 湯專門店,ChIJw__PrcerQjQRR68o5dQYYbg,4.4

IMP Matthew,1.0,"After six o'clock, two pastas and one roast vegetables, and at half past six, the meal is still not served. The point is that there are two tables next to us who are 10 minutes or 20 minutes behind us. Asked the waiter and told us that our noodles are cooked from raw so it takes a long time, and then it will be served after 2 minutes. So the mobile phone didn't bring anything after 2 minutes, so I had to leave decisively. I guess their noodles may still be growing in the fields waiting to be harvested.",a week ago,https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/117611657975336281872/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiNkbvrp7v5AhW9D0QIHVSiCk8QvfQBegUIARC9AQ,六點點完餐，兩份義大利麵和一份烤蔬菜，到了六點半餐都還沒上。重點是旁邊有兩桌比我們慢到10分鐘、20分鐘的客人，他們點的餐都已經上了，蝦子都吃完了。詢問服務人員，告知我們的麵是從生的開始煮所以比較久，然後2分鐘後就上菜。於是手機計時2分鐘還沒端東西上來，只好果斷離開，我猜他們的麵可能還長在田裡等收割吧。,Solo Pasta,ChIJwQPcmc-rQjQRtXDQA__PPwg,4.6

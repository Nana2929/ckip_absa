"光光","2022/05二訪 這次點了兩種清湯，花雕雞跟菇菇排骨湯。花雕雞非常的沒有花雕味，喝起來跟一般的雞清湯差不多喔覺得有點失望 排骨湯的排骨都是豬軟骨，不需要挑硬骨覺得很讚，但湯底味道就比較淡薄一點。 湯也很快就冷掉了，最後吃的有點辛苦。 主食點了小朋友義大利麵，餐上來是冷的不知道是不是正常🤔 清湯還是配白飯可能比較適合，美好的印象還留在濃湯配麵包，下次來可能還是會選擇濃湯系列。 大沙拉盤真的大🤣🤣🤣料好實在又豐富，煙燻鮭魚的厚度很讚！每次來一定點！ 之前在百貨公司美食街吃過，覺得普普通通，但這次到店面吃，餐飲體驗好很多 湯裡面的料也超級豐盛，燉牛肉也超級軟嫩，沾著麵包吃真的很爽，雖然桌子有點小不過東西真的好吃會再來～","5.0","5.0","","2 months ago","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkGFOdixeYW47EEiA3bP_a-dVgl8DIThQVp8eD | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkdksbosxOKvhXliW6fe9tcgXTZfQdEQtoQuGM | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOl95Akbet9d9d4KPHmDiQBJRhzmR0uyKAy7gzM | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJLQ-MZeA-FVLyTXLs3XyqKFp_vftin94n-J0V | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkSKnaRLEJbkWWOPeV9yLe-JGQz9WjnkixsKms","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116687461176653331342/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi_v97rp7v5AhXTLEQIHZ5uDwEQvfQBegQIARAC","www.google.com","","Soup Stock Store","1,466","4.4","No. 3號, Lane 240, Guangfu S Rd, Da’an District, Taipei City, Taiwan","ChIJw__PrcerQjQRR68o5dQYYbg","ChIJw__PrcerQjQRR68o5dQYYbg","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJw__PrcerQjQRR68o5dQYYbg"

"Manzih Hong","The dumplings are delicious, big and delicious, the pork filling with leeks is perfect! A piece of 8.5 yuan is very consistent with the CP value. Soups are worth ordering. There are a lot of ingredients. The oyster soup is delicious, but the hot and sour soup is not sour or spicy although it has a lot of ingredients. In terms of luwei, the most recommended is the braised cabbage head and the attached sauerkraut. I ordered the smoked Matsuzaka pork that everyone recommends, but the meat is very dry and the taste is quite salty. Other tofu skin, bitter gourd, and pig scalp are quite ordinary. I didn't give five stars because the environment is really dirty. I hope the boss can take a few days off to clean up the environment. Some places are covered with old dirt and dust, which is frightening. Due to environmental concerns, the frequency of meals will be minimized.","3.0","5.0","","a week ago","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWq7BKLM13pCRpLvFTZdZ5-A09wOAQh5AakLgk | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFRJCYXRGUhyv_SOXw6IdZf5rN5-LPKi8N2179 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjjsX2prVLaBjpKqvqJXZ_P4MnTUOVJR8MgXzJ | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRV6vqfLRw4cjUy1etEWXYwR7G4W54fkJDwryu | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMWOamFWEaBwL_5X9jmV8OkD6fvGCJq5-vV3wbQ | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN4UlhPD_9nyhtMrWBWwfVGeZG3jLK9uS9F888y | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJ1z5KAeJiajiCj3LKbP1GXK8SRHZBXRWF_H03","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/101105734907946771011/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiO_a_rp7v5AhULEEQIHdsLA1gQvfQBegQIARAr","www.google.com","水餃很好吃，大顆又美味，豬肉餡加上韭菜，完美！一顆8.5元很CP值相符。 湯類很值得點，料很多，蚵仔湯很好吃，但是酸辣湯雖然料多可不酸也不辣 滷味的話最推滷菜頭和附上的酸菜，點了大家都推薦的煙燻松阪肉，但是吃起來肉質很乾柴，口味也頗鹹，其他豆皮、苦瓜、豬頭皮都頗普通。 沒給到五顆星是因為環境真的太髒了，希望老闆可以找個幾天休假好好整理環境，有些地方佈滿了陳年的污垢和灰塵，令人怵目驚心。因為環境問題會儘量減少用餐頻率。","Nangang Beidahuang Dumpling Shop","7,351","3.8","No. 201, Section 1, Nangang Rd, Nangang District, Taipei City, Taiwan","ChIJv4dK1lirQjQRTurkPAZOiqA","ChIJv4dK1lirQjQRTurkPAZOiqA","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJv4dK1lirQjQRTurkPAZOiqA"

"Wei-Tsen Lai","The overall evaluation is medium, and the service is very good. If you want to eat pasta in the East District, you will think of it, but you will not go there specially. After eating this time, I feel that the pasta is better than the appetizer. Appetizer: The octopus was roasted very softly, and the refried beans below had a good taste, and there was no memory in it. Tripe: The stew is soft and rotten, and the sauce is delicious, but unfortunately the bread can't hold back the sauce, as if eating two separate things. pasta Cuttlefish Noodles: The first bite is amazing, it has umami, but the more you eat it, the more greasy Duck Breast Noodles: Today is the best. The sauce is very flavorful with vinegar added. The duck meat is also very tender.

"Sunny Chung","This is a soup restaurant The soups sold every day are not fixed. It is recommended to go to FB to see today's soups and check if there is anything you want to drink. In addition, it is also recommended to go to FB to confirm before departure, because other items will be changed after the soup is sold out. Otherwise, it is easy to see that after watching it at noon, you will find that it is different from what you watched at noon when you go to the scene at night. My personal favorite is the Mushroom Bamboo Shoot Cartilage Soup and Tomato Minced Pork Sauce Soup The soup with minced tomato and pork sauce tastes like Mapo tofu. XD Creamy soup is also good, suitable for dipping bread But I don't really like beef and wild vegetable stew in sauce. I feel that the taste of the sauce is too strong, covering the taste of beef and other ingredients. Chicken Caesar Salad is delicious and the portions are huge The chicken seasoning is also good The dining environment is very comfortable and the staff is very happy XD It's a shop I will visit again","5.0","5.0","","3 months ago","https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLumOzelryuGsR9fqFIVWk1yJwpRWaflQeBiet | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZv2pQqy9WI_86u6R5TYyGgIlnKD3aNqmA0bPW | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPMRCkr8mqt9_viFd_NB-kIZhg93dONS0G_bwLc | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP-whBBSqgEfFtDKxmGRUbWLZHoKhJgUYbJbNT1 | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjoJquMwwbp9kyq9TKkYzzCU7CYo2x3yfQISPt | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPWeec1TUYkTXOv8FJZCzFmY-bbd7mWUvvuU6nn | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP4X8t5lpG8pmcGgx5cV0zQwkJb4UTp2gaEetWd | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQagwcHZTcWcXlB3WYb4ZiQyAVL8gx99Wczmzy | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOg816yOLcQUFAc1OcKPZeea1X2wIsMQnWxlBto | https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeQoBQPOBMnaWasPpVJiEqkjcnjchDdPvsNWh7","https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105588276432935152992/reviews?hl=en-US&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi_v97rp7v5AhXTLEQIHZ5uDwEQvfQBegUIARCVAQ","www.google.com","這是一間以湯品為主的餐廳 每天販售的湯品不固定，建議可以先到FB看今日湯品，確認有沒有自己想喝的 另外也建議出發之前要再去FB確認，因為湯品售完之後會改其他品項 不然很容易發生中午看完之後，晚上到現場發現跟中午看的不一樣😂 個人最喜歡好菇竹筍軟骨湯跟番茄碎豬肉醬湯 番茄碎豬肉醬湯喝起來有種麻婆豆腐的香味XD 很下飯 奶油的湯也不錯，適合沾麵包 但個人不太喜歡醬汁牛肉野菜燉湯，覺得醬汁的味道太濃厚了，蓋掉牛肉跟其他食材的味道 凱撒沙拉雞肉很好吃，份量很大 雞肉的調味也很不錯 用餐環境很舒服，店員很歡樂XD 是會再回訪的店","Soup Stock Store","1,466","4.4","No. 3號, Lane 240, Guangfu S Rd, Da’an District, Taipei City, Taiwan","ChIJw__PrcerQjQRR68o5dQYYbg","ChIJw__PrcerQjQRR68o5dQYYbg","https://www.google.com/maps/place/?q=place_id:ChIJw__PrcerQjQRR68o5dQYYbg"

"Jason Yu","The most popular big dumplings and all kinds of lo-mei, in addition to selling pasta and soup. There will be a queue during meal times. The dumplings are one size larger than those sold by other stores, and there is only one kind of filling: minced pork + cabbage + chives; the filling is like a bun filling, which is quite elastic and firm, unlike ordinary dumpling fillings, you can use the dumplings here Imagine a bun with dumpling skin. Dine-in is 8.5 yuan, and a pack of 30 frozen dumplings is 240 yuan. There are about 20 kinds of lo mei items to choose from, such as dried tofu, kelp, beef, beef tendon, tripe, pig scalp, pig ears, pig nose...etc. The lo mei is placed at the door of the store. If you want to eat lo mei, you have to order it here. The store will burn it first, add Chaotian pepper and sauerkraut stalks, and then deliver it to your table. Luwei is delicious, and the result is that you want to eat everything. The amount of luwei at checkout often exceeds the amount of staple food (dumplings, pasta). The dry noodles are sweet and the taste is average. The pork liver of the pork liver soup is hard, and the soup is sweet, but it is quite smooth.

I was a little scared when I was at the table, but after taking a bite of beef filet, I thought it was the best beef I have ever eaten. I have eaten fried steak before. Maybe the frying technique is not good and it does not taste very good, but this is really It's delicious! Soft and fragrant, the taste with chicken curry is even more appetizing! The soup is mushroom-based miso soup. It tastes different from ordinary miso. The rich aroma after drinking makes people want to refill the bowl. I didn’t have time to go to try it out. A few days ago, I stopped by because my work ended early. There were no customers in the store at about 4 pm, but I heard that a few groups of customers came to reserve seats for the evening.

In the pasta part, the cuttlefish sauce is thick and fragrant; the meat sauce has many flavor-enhancing ingredients, and the layers are very rich.

"Jessica Huang","In fact, this is the second visit~ Because I have never been to Italy😆, I can't comment on the taste, but the store emphasizes that they attach great importance to tradition, which should be very authentic! Although the taste may not be very suitable for personal eating habits, but it definitely reflects the attention of the restaurant in cooking! (I just don't like meat-based food, so this time my favorite is basil green sauce noodles, tea and tiramisu) The shop assistants are also very kind! I have eaten duck breast noodles and cat ear noodles before, which should be considered meaty dishes~ Cheese roll is a dish I have never seen! It is also a taste I have never imagined. It has a citrus flavor in the middle and a ghee on the outer skin. If you have never tasted it, you can try it! Although I prefer tiramisu.

"Stanley Lin","20222.07 changed the name of the store, and there is a new menu of udon noodles, which is super delicious, the soup tastes very good, and there is a choice of two sauces, scallion sauce or pepper and spicy sauce, I like it very much! A shop I love very much. It uses solid ingredients. Every day, I continue to work hard to cook all kinds of delicious soups. I will order a set meal and enjoy two kinds of soups at a time. I have almost drank all the menus for one round. Love their classic beef stew and thick shrimp soup, the beef soup is tomato base, the beef stew is tender and chunky, with asparagus, peas, cheese, it's really rich, and when you want something refreshing Just pair it with witch soup. There are different vegetarian soups every day, and there are often surprises. The creamy porcini mushroom soup is a piece of chicken thigh. There are really foods that the store is so willing to make, and there are also cream or tomato flavors. The meat sauce soup, the point is that the dining environment is very good, it is a good place to eat and chat with friends, I really recommend it to everyone.
